  Writer & Researcher

    <p>
    I'm Ben--in case you missed that. Welcome to my portfolio. I'm a
    writer & researcher. Or a researcher & writer, whichever you,
    dear reader, need.
    </p>
    User experience is the central focus that makes my work cohere.
    I'm happy writing useful, human, testable copy for interactive
    interfaces.
    <p>
    The internet should be easy, searchable, and usable; it doesn't
    matter if you need a freelancer (ahem), you're shopping, or
    learning more about the big world. The words we choose can make
    it or break it.
    </p>
    As a UX writer and content strategist, I can help make interfaces
    consistent, clear, and easy to understand. Because designers and
    developers don't always do that.
    <p>
    UX writing is a new, specialized field, so people don't always
    know what to call this type of writing. I write copy, run
    usability studies, A/B test, iterate, and perfect.
    I've been called a technical writer, content writer, and a
    "genius." But that last one was from my mom. I currently have a
    full-time position, but I'm available for small projects on the
    side.
